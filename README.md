# Communicator-Web_version-
A web version of the Gellish Communicator App using RemiGUI
The Gellish Communicator project develops a stand-alone app that uses Tkinter for its GUI.
This project aim to develop a web based version that uses RemiGUI instead of Tkinter.
RemiGUI creates HTML and uses an ordaniry browser such as Safari to create and display input and output.
For the time being this is done in a separate repository, because this is an experimental version.
